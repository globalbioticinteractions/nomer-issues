All this took about 2-3 hours of hacking, and gives some estimate of the skill and time needed to access the valuable data stored in the DiscoverLife Bee pages. \r\n\r\nGiven that most researchers probably don't have the skill (or desire) to do these kinds of data exercises, I suspect that they'll either hand-off the work to others (undergrads, engineers) or otherwise spend more time collecting the same or similar data that is already available via DiscoverLife. Perhaps something to consider when preparing this discoverlife archive for publication somewhere?
