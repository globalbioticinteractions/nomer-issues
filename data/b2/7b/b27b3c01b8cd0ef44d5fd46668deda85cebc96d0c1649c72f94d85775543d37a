Because I am using a single trusted source I can automate a lot of the name update procedures using the export results form Nomer. Here are some proposed features I think will make data updating smoother.\r\n\r\nIn the higher taxonomy the data jumps from alignedFamilyName down to  alignedGenusName. This ignore SubFamily, Tribe, and Subtribe. Those data are available in alignedPath and alignedPathNames fields. Having them already parsed out like family and genus would save me a lot of manual copy and paste.\r\nExamples:\r\nBiota | Animalia | Arthropoda | Insecta | Coleoptera | Scarabaeoidea | Scarabaeidae | Aegialiinae | Aegialiini | Aegialia | Aegialia arenaria\r\nunranked | kingdom | phylum | class | order | superfamily | family | subfamily | tribe | genus | species\r\n\r\nFor catalog of life, at least they have the author attached to higher taxonomy and if it could be included in the export that would save a lot of copy and paste and the back end. Here is a sample higher taxa link form catalog of life.\r\nhttps://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/taxon/8RYS7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/159/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
