Please note that you are seeing a known issue v0.2.6 issue (see https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/61), that has been resolved in v0.2.7. Suggest to use the latest Nomer v0.2.8 to benefit from recent fixes and functionality. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you get the chance, you might want to install long-term supported versions of OpenJDK 8 or 11  (preferably OpenJDK 8) instead of the current version of java jvm (v13 I believe) that you are using now. These are the versions that Nomer is developed and tested on. \r\n\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshot from https://access.redhat.com/articles/1299013 .\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-11-13 02-32-26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/141615332-49c85875-2472-4186-ae38-258963ff520b.png)\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/968029602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/968051100","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/62#issuecomment-968051100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/62","id":968051100,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc45s0mc","user":{"login":"seltmann","id":1044474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1044474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann","html_url":"https://github.com/seltmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-13T11:06:43Z","updated_at":"2021-11-13T11:06:43Z","body":"@jhpoelen Ah!
