How are you affiliated with this working group? \r\n\r\nIn reading through the linked content, I particularly noticed [1] -\r\n\r\n---\r\n[...]\r\n<h3><strong>Specific Outcomes:</strong></h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>A recommendation for the best practice in creating a collection/package of digital objects that are hosted by one or more data centers.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Research infrastructure that enables credit to be acknowledged for each individual element of a collection/package of digital objects. </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Journal guidance that supports authors using a collection/package that enables citation of each individual digital object.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn the context of biodiversity data, we've developed some methods ([2],[3], cc @mielliott) and explicit use cases [4] to achieve exactly that. For example, recently, we've shown that a collection of >800k herbarium images (photos of cataloged squashed dried plants) from the Botanical Research Institute can be cited ([4], cc @jbest), distributed, and copied using many methods (e.g., physical transport via postal service, digital transfer via transatlantic internet, local transfer via USB, distributed publication across heterogeneous storage solutions) without losing the ability to cite and retrieve the original tracked content.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I believe we've developed some methods, prototypes and use cases that may be of interest to the RDA Complex Citations working group. What do you think would be the best way to bring our work to their attention?\r\n\r\n-jorrit\r\nhttps://jhpoelen.nl\r\n\r\nPS Note that the RDA Complex Citation Working group page does not offer a citation methods to track specific versions of their working group page. This is why I tracked a copy of the page using [Preston](https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston) and published a copy at https://github.com/jhpoelen/rda-complex-citations.
