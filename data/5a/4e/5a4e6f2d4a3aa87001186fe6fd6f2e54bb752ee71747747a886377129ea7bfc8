However, I am facing an issue using the globi-taxon-cache matcher (which I guess is faster than globi-enrich) with taxids. For instance, with GBIF:2436436 (Homo sapiens):\r\n\r\n```\r\necho -e 'GBIF:2436436\\t' | nomer append\r\nusing default matcher [globi-taxon-cache]\r\nGBIF:2436436\t\tNONE\tGBIF:2436436\thttp://www.gbif.org/species/2436436\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame problem using the NCBI taxid. However, it works with EOL id : the id is resolved against the different taxonomies. Any advice ?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
