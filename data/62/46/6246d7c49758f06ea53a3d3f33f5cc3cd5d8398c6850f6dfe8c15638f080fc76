For example., this from the \"behind the scenes\" comments in Batnames:  Doryrhina was previously considered a synonym of Hipposideros; but clearly distinct; see Foley et al. (2017). Based on Foley et al. (2017), some authors (Tuneu-Corral, 2019; Mammal Diversity Database, 2021) have transferred the Hipposideros species corynophyllus, muscinus, semoni, stenotis, and wollastoni to Doryrhina; however, Foley et al. (2017) did not conduct any molecular analyses with these species and explicitly stated that these species were in need of additional study to determine their placement. We prefer to retain these species in Hipposideros until that review can be conducted. The species edwardshilli has also been transferred to Doryrhina by Tuneu-Corral (2019) and the Mammal Diversity Database (2021), without comment.\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo, additional work is needed to support synonyms etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1193046953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
