One possible configuration might be something like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\r\n{\"@context\": {\"@vocab\": \"http://example.com/\", \"parent\":  {\"@type\": \"@id\"}},\r\n    \"@graph\": [\r\n    {\"name\": \"Animalia\",    \"rank\": \"kingdom\",  \"@id\": \"GBIF:1\"},\r\n    {\"name\": \"Chordata\",    \"rank\": \"phylum\",   \"@id\": \"GBIF:44\",      \"parent\": \"GBIF:1\"},\r\n    {\"name\": \"Mammalia\",    \"rank\": \"class\",    \"@id\": \"GBIF:359\",     \"parent\": \"GBIF:44\"},\r\n    {\"name\": \"Carnivora\",   \"rank\": \"order\",    \"@id\": \"GBIF:732\",     \"parent\": \"GBIF:359\"},\r\n    {\"name\": \"Canidae\",     \"rank\": \"family\",   \"@id\": \"GBIF:9701\",    \"parent\": \"GBIF:732\"},\r\n    {\"name\": \"Canis\",       \"rank\": \"genus\",    \"@id\": \"GBIF:5219142\", \"parent\": \"GBIF:9701\" },\r\n    {\"name\": \"Canis lupus\", \"rank\": \"species\",  \"@id\": \"GBIF:5219173\", \"parent\": \"GBIF:5219142\"}\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can equivalently be represented as a set of triples, but is quite nice in JSON.  JSON is easier to parse than pipe strings, and the JSON-LD algorithms can be nice for manipulating this, e.g. to converted it into a nested structure by parent or by child (e.g. by defining the `@reverse` property in the `@context`, see the above example in the [JSON-LD Playground](http://tinyurl.com/y7mczavv) .  \r\n\r\nThis can also obviously be rendered to the equivalent rdf.  Clearly one would want a more intelligent choice for `@context` than the `\"@vocab\" : \"http://example.com\"`, e.g. the rank terms should probably be defined in darwin core, etc; that's probably in the source data anyway.  \r\n\r\nI didn't play with this example yet mixing and matching entries from different authorities, but clearly that would be important.  Obviously if you had all the different examples in the above format you could already query the JSON to say, give me all `@id`s that have `\"name\": \"Canis lupus\"` (and maybe also have `\"rank\": \"species\"`), so it would be a good start already, though it might be interesting to think about adding triples/statements explicitly defining some relation between them.

I like the idea of bold statements like NCBI:9606 sameAs GBIF:2436436 because it invites discussion and help to codify assumptions that are often implicitly made already. Isn't a _Homo sapiens_ a _Homo sapiens_ ? I'd even argue that _Homo sapiens_ sameAs _Homo sapiens_ (often used) is less accurate than NCBI:9606 sameAs GBIF:2436436 , because the ids define (by reference) an explicit taxonomic context, whereas the strings leaves the machine (and most humans) guessing: is this just a sequence of characters or a taxonomic name? \r\n\r\nJson-ld example looks pretty good, I'd go for including the sameAs things and making the rank a little more explicit like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"@context\": {\"@vocab\": \"http://example.com/\", \"parent\":  {\"@type\": \"@id\"}},\r\n    \"@graph\": [\r\n    {\"name\": \"kingdom\", \"@id\": \"GBIF_RANK:1\" },\r\n   { \"name\": \"phylum\", \"@id\", \"GBIF_RANK:2\", \"parent\": \"GBIF_RANK_1\"},\r\n    {\"name\": \"Animalia\",    \"rank\": \"GBIF_RANK:1\",  \"@id\": \"GBIF:1\"},\r\n    {\"name\": \"Chordata\",    \"rank\": \"GBIF_RANK:2\",   \"@id\": \"GBIF:44\",      \"parent\": \"GBIF:1\"},\r\n      ...\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that with existing features, using tab separated lines with pipes for internal arrays, you can do searches like \"give me all the Anura, but exclude the plants \"(note that, in addition to being an amphibian order, Anura is also a plant genus):\r\n\r\n```cat [some names] | java -jar nomer.jar append | grep \"Anura\" | grep -v \"Plantae\" ```\r\n\r\nGranted that it is not as semantically explicit, is it quite fast and be quite accurate after perhaps using some column selection using awk.

It certainly seems justified to assert that an NCBI identifier is the `sameAs` the GBIF identifier when the strings match and all, though I imagine there are some edge cases like where one authority has split a species and the other has not.\r\n\r\nYeah, I do like the simplicity of the pipe lists, (and looks like they have a precedent in Darwin core higherTaxonomy?) but they can be tricky to use when you want to keep track of which rank `Anura` is supposed to refer to, and maybe according to which authority. I tell my students that `grep` should be thought of as a last resort, when the data provider hasn't given you a more structured way of doing something, since it is easier for it to have unanticipated side-effects like getting plant genus instead of a vertebrate order!  So in general, I think a well-thought-out JSON structure would be ideal.\r\n\r\nGood question about the JSON-LD framing.  My thinking was that the nice thing about JSON-LD frames is that it gives the user (or at least the app developer) some control over what their preferred JSON-LD structure might be -- in particular, I was thinking that it might be nicer for the user to have a nested JSON file than to have to resolve the `parent` links manually, and JSON-LD handles that rather nicely (even letting you reverse the nesting).  However, with a little more thought, I'm not really sure that a nested structure is particularly useful.  I think what most researchers would find most intuitive would be for rank names to act as keys rather than values in the JSON, something like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n      \"species\": {\"name\":  \"Canis lupus\", \"@id\": \"GBIF:5219173\", \"sameAs\": \"ITIS:180596\", ...},\r\n      \"genus\":   {\"name\":  \"Canis\", \"@id\": \"GBIF:5219142\"},\r\n      \"family\":  {\"name\":  \"Canidae\",  \"@id\": \"GBIF:9701\"},\r\n      \"order\":   {\"name\":  \"Carnivora\", \"@id\": \"GBIF:359\"},\r\n      \"class\":   {\"name\": \"Mammalia\",\"@id\": \"GBIF:732\"},\r\n      \"phylum\":  {\"name\": \"Chordata\",  \"@id\": \"GBIF:44\"},\r\n      \"subkingdom\": {\"name\": \"Bilateria\", \"@id\": \"ITIS:914154\"}, \r\n      \"kingdom\": {\"name\": \"Animalia\",  \"@id\": \"GBIF:1\"}\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you think something like that is possible?  It is clearly a little more dicey semantically --  it requires divorcing the rank levels (like `phylum`, `subphylum` etc) from a particular authority, and it also doesn't leave room for different authorities to have different name strings for the same rank (though I think that is implicit in using `sameAs`).  Maybe those issues (and maybe others) make it unworkable, but I think it corresponds to how most ecologists want to think about and use taxonomic names. \r\n\r\n e.g. at least for something like this wolf, ITIS might provide additional ranks, but agrees about the names of all the ranks that match GBIF ranks (i.e. both agree the \"Class\" is \"Mammalia\").  not sure if that would hold in general.

My thoughts / premise so far: \r\n\r\n1. I agree most researchers in my field will find tabular formats most intuitive; hence was really excited to learn about the existing tabular records you already have on Zenodo.  \r\n2. As you know, there's a natural nesting to this data that makes tabular formats potentially cumbersome (e.g. pipe string issues).  I agree with you that providing a range of tabular formats is probably the way to go, but I'm also curious about the potential to use JSON-LD instead if it can provide a more 'natural' solution than messing with tabular formats.\r\n3. I'm curious about the semantic tools, and more broadly, about forging better links between the practical needs of researchers and the rather interesting work of the informatics community.  JSON-LD seems like a way to have-cake-and-eat-it-too, in that I think it can have some of the user-friendly-ness of plain `tsv` files while also remaining an explicitly valid link-data format that's directly posed for applying semantic tooling like sparql, and also web-friendly\r\n\r\nSo those are pretty vague thinking at this point, but this data seems to be about the right complexity (simple but not trivial) to dive into this exploration.  \r\n\r\nDid that make any sense?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/388145410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
