The original idea was to have all archive releases (every 3-ish months) on Zenodo (ex: [1st release](https://zenodo.org/records/7331329) for the goat-paper). We support UI querying for the archives as a dropdown on the main page (see image), and the API links can be generated for each as well.\r\n> We anchor our names to the ncbi taxonomy and supplement them with TolID prefixes as placeholders while the request of a taxonID goes through with ENA. The following links can retrieve the current list of names for bats in the [UI](https://goat.genomehubs.org/search?query=tax_tree%289397%5BChiroptera%5D%29&result=taxon&includeEstimates=true&taxonomy=ncbi&size=25&offset=0&fields=none&names=synonym%2Ctolid_prefix%2Ccommon_name&ranks=subspecies%2Cspecies%2Cgenus%2Cfamily%2Corder&sortBy=genus&sortOrder=asc#tax_tree(9397%5BChiroptera%5D)) and [API](https://goat.genomehubs.org/api/v2/search?query=tax_tree%289397%5BChiroptera%5D%29&result=taxon&includeEstimates=true&taxonomy=ncbi&size=25&offset=0&fields=none&names=synonym%2Ctolid_prefix%2Ccommon_name&ranks=subspecies%2Cspecies%2Cgenus%2Cfamily%2Corder&sortBy=genus&sortOrder=asc#tax_tree(9397%5BChiroptera%5D)), respectively. Note that I just added /api/v2/ to turn the first link into the last.\r\nThat also work for different releases by using /api/{archive date}/ .\r\nFor example, using the /lookup endpoint to find all names linked to a species in the [latest](https://goat.genomehubs.org/api/v2/lookup?searchTerm=Artibeus%20cinereus&result=taxon&size=100&taxonomy=ncbi&suggestSize=3&gramSize=3&maxErrors=3&confidence=1) versus [march](https://goat.genomehubs.org/api/2024.03.01/lookup?searchTerm=Artibeus%20cinereus&result=taxon&size=100&taxonomy=ncbi&suggestSize=3&gramSize=3&maxErrors=3&confidence=1) releases will have equivalent links but different dates.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceae4319-c7ec-4495-93e0-9ca65a64deb8)\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/2455172084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
