Same is true for author names in with those services. \r\n\r\nFor example: \r\necho -e \"\\tEchinocereus engelmannii subsp. engelmannii\" | nomer append wfo\r\nreturns:\r\n Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. engelmannii\tHAS_ACCEPTED_NAME\tWFO:0001430711\tEchinocereus engelmannii subsp. engelmannii\tsubspecies\tAngiosperms | Caryophyllales | Cactaceae | Echinocereus | Echinocereus engelmannii | Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. engelmannii\tWFO:9949999999 | WFO:9000000088 | WFO:7000000098 | WFO:4000012914 | WFO:0000661245 | WFO:0001430711\tphylum | order | family | genus | species | subspecies\thttp://www.worldfloraonline.org/taxon/wfo-0001430711\r\n\r\nHowever removing one of the trailing i's (a possibly common mistake in data entry) from the subsp. results in failure to resolve:\r\n\r\necho -e \"\\tEchinocereus engelmannii subsp. engelmanni\" | nomer append wfo\r\nreturns:\r\nEchinocereus engelmannii subsp. engelmanni\tNONE\t\tEchinocereus engelmannii subsp. engelmanni\r\n\r\nhere, you could specify the max distance field = 1, allowing for a fuzzy match to return Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. engelmannii\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
