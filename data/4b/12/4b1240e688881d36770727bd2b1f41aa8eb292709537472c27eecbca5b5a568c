Also, I wonder what their policy is on retiring taxonomic identifiers.

The two organisations remain separate and different in structure. However, by working together in creating a common product, the partnership has enabled them to reduce duplication of effort, make better use of resources, and to accelerate production. The combined Annual Checklist has become well established as a cited reference used for data compilation and comparison. For instance, it is used as the principal taxonomic index in the GBIF and EoL data portals and recognised by the CBD.\r\n\r\n\r\n@mdoering @gdower Can you please help us understand the policy on taxonomic ids issued by Catalogue of Life?\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-07-28 11-23-39](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/assets/1084872/2a44f58a-982f-4780-a74a-35f6bdfa0b05)\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1655964991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1655997928","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/159#issuecomment-1655997928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/159","id":1655997928,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc5itIXo","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-28T16:49:49Z","updated_at":"2023-07-28T16:49:49Z","body":"Note, by the way, that a identical query to https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/159#issuecomment-1655947728 applied to the current version of Catalogue of Life yielded only the \"newer\" taxonomic identifers, and the older ones were not to be found.
