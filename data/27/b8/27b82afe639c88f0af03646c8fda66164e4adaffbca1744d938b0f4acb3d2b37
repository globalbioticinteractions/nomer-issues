I would try to avoid deciding which name is correct unless you really need to, since that's a much harder problem than deciding that two names differing in ending are the same.\r\n\r\nYou don't need full Latin stemming because we only care about nominative singular endings; the code you link appears to also handle other cases and verb forms, which is much harder. My notes on common adjectives that show up in mammal nomenclature are at http://hesperomys.com/docs/species-name-complex; you'll get most of the way there just unifying _-us/-a/-um_, _-is/-e_, and a few special cases like _major_/_majus_ and _niger_/_nigra_.\r\n\r\nA similar problem concerns names ending in _-i_ vs. _-ii_; those very frequently lead to spelling variations. The [ICZN](https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-code-online/) Article 58 specifies a number of patterns that make two species names into homonyms even if they have slightly different spellings. In my experience, _-i_ vs. _-ii_ is by far the most common among those, but you could try to also normalize some of the others. However, those rules apply only if the derivation of the two names is the same, which is difficult to figure out programmatically.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1400686803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1400733244","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/143#issuecomment-1400733244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/143","id":1400733244,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc5TfX48","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-23T17:41:37Z","updated_at":"2023-01-23T17:41:37Z","body":"@JelleZijlstra thanks for sharing your insights and notes.\r\n\r\n> Is your use case here to facilitate searching, so e.g. someone searching for Lycalopex vetulus will see results whether the original author of the information in your database spelled it vetulus or vetula?\r\n\r\nYes, in this context, my use case is to make it easier to relate likely variations of the same name to help facilitate integration and review across existing datasets (e.g., a user performing some interactive search, your efforts with n8upham to compare MDD/Hesperomys). \r\n\r\nIn my mind, these auto-generated relation suggestions are likely less valuable than the (opinionated?) claims by experts.

It does appears that gnparser's approach is a little more sophisticated compared to the simplistic \"see-what-sticks\" approach used by Nomer.

Continuous progress is made towards completion, but for now, it probably includes just over 80% of the world's known species. The Catalogue of Life estimates 2.3M extant species on the planet recognised by taxonomists at present time. This means that for many groups it continues to be deficient, and users may notice that many species are still missing from the Catalogue.\r\n\r\n  ### What's new in August 2023 edition ?\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n[1] Poelen, J.

Lots of details needed to trace the provenance of a COL archive apparently. . . I wish less would be needed to track down these datasets.
