So, instead of using the (dynamic and often changing) internet, Nomer relies on a well-defined versioned slice of it. And, your newer copy of GBIF's backbone it's defined in that slice (see e.g. list tracked urls/aliases in https://zenodo.org/record/6473194 ).\r\n\r\nTo disable Nomer's reliance on it's versioned corpus, you can blank out the preston properties, by changing -\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nomer properties | grep preston\r\nnomer.preston.dir=\r\nnomer.preston.remotes=https://zenodo.org/record/6473194/files\r\nnomer.preston.version=hash://sha256/d58ab1acf350f056a75bde7f4175d14c5e4dfaf0bf20e2eedbb2fb585bdf0822\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```\r\nnomer properties | grep preston\r\nnomer.preston.dir=\r\nnomer.preston.remotes=\r\nnomer.preston.version=\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that reconfiguration, you'd sample the internet directly, and Nomer should download directly from the internet location.\r\n\r\nApologies for the confusion.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1164755928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1164758908","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/86#issuecomment-1164758908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/86","id":1164758908,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc5FbM98","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-23T18:54:51Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T18:54:51Z","body":"@zedomel alternatively, we could build a new version of Nomer's Corpus of Taxonomic Resources that points to your more recent copy of the GBIF backbone in addition to updating the default Nomer property config.\r\n\r\nPerhaps easier? \r\n\r\nLet me know.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1164758908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1164865894","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/86#issuecomment-1164865894","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/86","id":1164865894,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc5FbnFm","user":{"login":"zedomel","id":7684564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2ODQ1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7684564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel","html_url":"https://github.com/zedomel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-23T20:57:13Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T20:57:13Z","body":"Thank for quick answer @jhpoelen .\r\n\r\nBuild a new version sounds interesting, but for now I will blank out preston properties.

Apologies for the nomer.jar . . . I omitted to prepend the .travis.jar.magic file to the nomer.jar using\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat .travis.jar.magic nomer/target/nomer-0.5.7-jar-with-dependencies.jar > nomer.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've updated the artifact - please try again.\r\n\r\nHmm. Perhaps a good reason to automate this distribution process. . . . what do you think?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1994458637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1995859694","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/86#issuecomment-1995859694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/86","id":1995859694,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc529mbu","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-13T21:19:19Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T21:19:19Z","body":"@zedomel also, please holler if you were able to use the updated nomer.jar v0.5.7 with the upgraded GBIF backbone you published.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I figuring out how to allow for overrides - like the one you tried by blanking out the preston configuration.\r\n\r\nThanks for being patient.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1995859694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1997251036","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/86#issuecomment-1997251036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/86","id":1997251036,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc53C6Hc","user":{"login":"zedomel","id":7684564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2ODQ1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7684564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel","html_url":"https://github.com/zedomel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zedomel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-14T11:38:53Z","updated_at":"2024-03-14T11:38:53Z","body":"@jhpoelen it worked.\r\nThank you.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1997251036/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
