I would agree that the processes need to be much more transparent.\r\n\r\nIn regard to this example, I can make some comments. First, COL for many years relied on the NHM version of LepIndex for its Lepidoptera classification. This was certainly the most complete resource available, but deeply flawed in many ways.\r\n\r\nA version of LepIndex was imported a few years ago into TaxonWorks and has been somewhat cleaned at least for some sections of the order, although butterflies and noctuoid moths still have MANY issues. You can read some more here: https://stangeia.hobern.net/global-lepidoptera-index/. Among other things, I have reviewed the names within GBIF for which the largest numbers of records were unresolved by COL/LepIndex and have fixed many of these, including Aglais io.\r\n\r\nThe update dates in ChecklistBank/COL relate to the dataset as a whole rather than individual species. This is undesirable, and COL does have mechanisms for datasets to supply actual per-record curation dates. You can see an example here for a moth from a family that I (currently) still curate outside TaxonWorks: https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/taxon/98XPG - at present TaxonWorks is not exposing this level of detail. I should explore with them how they can offer it.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1299452496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1300321085","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/124#issuecomment-1300321085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/124","id":1300321085,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc5NgVM9","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-02T12:41:18Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T12:41:18Z","body":"@dhobern thanks for taking the time to respond and for providing context for the [Aglais io] name review that Jeff Ollerton noticed. \r\n\r\nI've added a note at https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/198 to have a peek at ways to track checklist bank and their related source archives.
