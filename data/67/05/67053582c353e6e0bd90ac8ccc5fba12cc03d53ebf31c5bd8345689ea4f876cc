I guess the closer I can get is using globi-globalnames with the taxon name.\r\n\r\nHowever, I know that this kind of mapping is done in GloBi, so I was wondering how you did that, and if it could be reused in nomer ?\r\n\r\nBest regards.","closed_by":{"login":"nleguillarme","id":44698109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Njk4MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44698109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nleguillarme","html_url":"https://github.com/nleguillarme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nleguillarme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nleguillarme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nleguillarme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nleguillarme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nleguillarme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nleguillarme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nleguillarme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nleguillarme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nleguillarme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/22/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/22/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
