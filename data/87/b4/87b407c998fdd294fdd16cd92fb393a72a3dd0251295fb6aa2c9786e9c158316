For example, Araniella cucurbitina (Linnaeus, 1758) is a synonym (loosely defined) of Araniella cucurbitina (Clerck, 1757), but this is not presented in the output in a way that is understandable (since the first authority string isn't given). And regardless it probably isn't helpful for any of the use cases of nomer (since nomer is supposed to map names to \"other names\"). It would probably be best to just filter out these types of synonyms from the output.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
