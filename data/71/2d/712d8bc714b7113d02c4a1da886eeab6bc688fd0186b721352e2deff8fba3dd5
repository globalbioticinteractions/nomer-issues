While this speed may be sufficient for point-and-click websites and portals, order of magnitudes of throughput increases are needed to allow for reviewing nbn identifiers/names in small to medium sized datasets using NBN . \n\nan example of such dataset is DoPI - \n\nBalfour, N.J., Castellanos, M.C., Goulson, D., Philippides, A. and Johnson, C., 2022. DoPI: The Database of Pollinator Interactions. Ecology, 103, e3801.\n\nwith data derived from:\n\nBalfour, N. J. (2025). The Database of Pollinator Interactions (DoPI) Dataset [Data set]. In Ecology (Version 1, Vol. 103, Number 11, p. e3801). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15224385\n\nTo help achieve this speed, **a NBN data archive is needed**. With an versioned archive, an optimized NBN name/id resolver can be created without go through the Web API and their throughput limitation.\n\n  ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
