This will compare processing verbatim data vs provider data, inclusion of fuzzy mapping vs exclusion, and with this topic hopefully certainty in designation status. \r\n\r\nIm overall curious as to how these \"Doubtful\", as well as the \"Unchecked\" names contribute to my data's name resolution using World Flora Online. It seems to me that quantitative stats might allow us to get a better idea of their overall presence in large datasets and whether their magnitude of effect is considerable for final resolution.\r\n\r\nWhen I was doing some quality control on my resolved names with multiple mappings I happened to notice that one of the names I was considering remapping would remap to a \"Doubtful\" name, (see _Ilex california_ , http://www.worldfloraonline.org/taxon/wfo-0001265295). \r\n\r\nInitially I thought not to include it since it seems uncertain anyway, however I realized that wouldn't be uniform methodology (since there its quite probable other \"Doubtful\" names mapped into my dataset). This posses the question of whether I should trust these names enough to incorporate into the analysis when there is uncertainty surrounding them. WFO hasn't made it clear as to what makes a plant designation \"ambiguous\" which maps to the \"Doubtful\" relation besides that they derive it from a source to infer that (in my example Tropicos), so unfortunately I can't fully determine what is safe and problematic to use here.

Unchecked indicates the record has not gone through scrutiny by taxonomic experts as of yet or is experiencing conflicting designations. The term doubtful is exactly the same as their designation of ambiguous. Ambiguous records originate from records that cannot be resolved due to one or more of the following: poor description, no voucher specimen available to confirm, or no illustration/media of voucher specimen. These designation types are maintained as names since its up to the Curator if they wish to use it for their collection however. \r\n\r\nFor large scale research questions utilizing a broad range of taxa, this seems to present an issue since it suggests they are less trackable names that are nested in ambiguity.

Could this conceivably be added to Nomer's properties call? It would be very informative for creating datasets of multiple levels of assurance, i.e. one of only taxonomic expert review, one with accepting some error with unchecked, and a dataset looking at how doubtful names affect occurrence data pulls.\r\n\r\nThe way I see this is instead of the following functionality: \r\n`echo -e \"\\tHyospathe chiriqui\" | nomer append wfo`\r\nreturns: \r\nHyospathe chiriqui\tHAS_ACCEPTED_NAME\tWFO:0001316767\tHyospathe chiriqui\tSchaedtler\tspecies\t\tHyospathe chiriqui\tWFO:0001316767\tspecies\t\thttp://www.worldfloraonline.org/taxon/wfo-0001316767\r\n\r\nHAS_ACCEPTED_NAME should be swapped with IS_AMBIGUOUS, leaving it up to the user to accept/remove these records based upon their knowledge rather than confirming it to HAS_ACCEPTED_NAME status.\r\n\r\nThanks!

The name is checked and has been defined by WFO to be doubtful due to lacking a type specimen and/or enough description to justify its name. Unchecked names are still present in WFO; however, those are names that haven't received any taxonomic scrutiny as defined by wfo's standards. I currently treat these as innocent till proven guilty (as a large number of names are this way), but that may need to change. Good to see we can pull out the unchecked field, I'll take a look into how many of these are actually present in NA plant data.

We thought it would be useful to share our workings.\r\n\r\n**Some background for the uninitiated.**\r\n\r\nWe (RBG Edinburgh) took over responsibility for the Plant List (taxonomic backbone) for the WFO from last year to free up the guys at Missouri to work on content for the portal. We built a new system to handle the list and in doing that we introduced a bit more rigorous data model. At the moment what you see through the portal will be somewhat confusing because it continues to use some of the old terminology. \r\n\r\nData on the plant list is exposed via a web service (here https://list.worldfloraonline.org/). It is also published to Zenodo and GBIF ChecklistBank on a six monthly cycle. The web service is used to power the plant list section of the WFO portal here (https://wfoplantlist.org/plant-list/).\r\n\r\nWe have a taxonomic editor we have built called Rhakhis that the Taxonomic Expert Networks can use to edit data directly.\r\n\r\n** Taxonomic and nomenclatural status **\r\n\r\nWe are working on some overarching documentation (work in progress!) but it is all in github and you can see it being created here.\r\n\r\nhttps://plant-list-docs.rbge.info/concepts.html\r\n\r\nWe have a strong separation of nomenclature vs taxonomy and so separation of nomenclatural status and taxonomic status.\r\n\r\nhttps://plant-list-docs.rbge.info/concepts.html#taxonomic-status--role\r\n\r\nI was very keen to eliminate \"doubtful\" and \"unchecked\" for which I couldn't extract good definitions.  Doubtful about what exactly? How doubtful?  Who doubts? Unchecked is usually an editorial status not a decision. i.e. a property of the system not the name. We use \"unknown\" because we may have \"checked\" but failed to resolve it. We all suffer from a reluctance to admit ignorance :)\r\n\r\nWe introduced the notion of \"deprecated\" names.\r\n\r\nhttps://plant-list-docs.rbge.info/concepts.html#more-on-deprecation\r\n\r\nThis is all just what we are doing to build our list of all plants. Other people may have other requirements but obviously as we are not using \"doubtful\" we don't think it is a good idea to use it.\r\n\r\nWe have made the progress we have made mainly because we have ignored animals! This is very much focussed on the botanical code of nomenclature.\r\n\r\nAnyhow I hope this is useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1541906662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1542727187","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/100#issuecomment-1542727187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/100","id":1542727187,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc5b9CYT","user":{"login":"jtmiller28","id":82229873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjI5ODcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82229873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28","html_url":"https://github.com/jtmiller28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-10T19:55:30Z","updated_at":"2023-05-10T19:55:30Z","body":"Thanks @rogerhyam! Im glad the ambiguity surrounding unchecked and doubtful designations is being disentangled into more informative categories. Sounds like in the future we'll be able to see these designations which will be really helpful for research applications. \r\n\r\n@jhpoelen Would it be interesting/worthwhile to capture that snapshot (https://wfoplantlist.org/plant-list/) as a catalog for Nomer as its a stable version of checked names? We can still use the current catalog portal, but it contains ambiguity and requires filtering past the level that most users would know (i.e. properties and removal of Unchecked names).
