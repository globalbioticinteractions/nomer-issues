To do this, we need to figure out a way for both OBO's NCBITaxon and Nomer's ncbi matcher to list the exact version of NCBI they used. I've started looking into this by creating (reliably) citable versions of taxonomic resources (see #48 ). I am not sure how OBO's NCBITaxon keeps track of the version of NCBI Taxonomy they use. Perhaps @cmungall et al. knows more about this.\r\n\r\nA second point you raised is to make provide a mapping from the Nomer NCBI prefixes (i.e. ```NCBI```, ```NCBITaxon```, ```NCBI:txid```, and ```http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_```). Note that Nomer already \"understands\" the listed NCBI prefixes. And, Nomer uses NCBI: as a default when producing links into NCBI taxonomy. \r\n\r\nSo, if you say:\r\n\r\n```echo \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_9606\" | nomer append ncbi```, I'd expect the result to be something like: \r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_9606 [blank] SAME_AS NCBI:9606 Homo sapiens ...\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan you help me better understand how you'd imagine using the proposed feature by providing a detailed example?
