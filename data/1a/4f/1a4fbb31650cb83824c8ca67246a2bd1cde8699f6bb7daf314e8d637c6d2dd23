Taxonomic keys are in table format which might be what messed up the information extraction. Nevertheless, I have no idea where the genus rank came from in the first assertion. I would look into it tomorrow and would probably reprocess this particular paper to figure out why these ranks are messed up. Regarding the second example, the taxonomic key actually does not mention the rank of _Bolacothrips striatopennatus_.

So far, we only attributed dwc:verbatimRank if the <taxon-name> node in the XML had a specific attribute (taxon-name-part-type) but some taxonomic names don't (as was the case in the XML which contained openbiodiv:22A7F215-829B-458A-AEBB-39FFEA6D4A91).\r\nI have found a way to update some of the names in OpenBiodiv without a rank if they have a GBIF taxon associated with them which has a rank and the taxonomic name in question has now been affected by the update and has a rank 'species'.\r\nOther updates (e.g. based on the presence of a dwc:specificEpithet) would be too risky because there are some cases in which the rank is not 'species' but 'subspecies' or other. \r\n\r\nThank you for pointing out the issue so that I can improve the LOD!
