thinking about the pipe string manipulation and alternatives.  \r\n\r\nBuilding on your idea of providing some alternate tabular representations to meet different use cases, I think it would be particularly useful to be able to have each rank a a separate columns.  \r\n\r\nMy my tally, there's about 125 different terms that are used in `pathName` pipe strings:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  [1] \"kingdom\"

(I think it might be preferable for some of that mapping to be in a clean version of taxonCache representation, but maybe that's ill-advised to alter the original data strings in that way).  \r\n\r\nHaving just the handful of ranks defined in Darwin Core as columns would be a particularly minimal but convenient starting point, though it would seem pretty manageable to include a few `sub`, `super`, `infra` divisions as additional columns.  What do you think?\r\n\r\nThis leaves open a question of mapping the `pathIds` into this schema; but perhaps that could be a separate table or just a duplicate row?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
