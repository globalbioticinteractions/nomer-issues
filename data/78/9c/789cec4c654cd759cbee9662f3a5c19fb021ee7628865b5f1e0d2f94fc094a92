It is curated to a 19th century standard. We want to verify the names in the collection were once correct. As I am aligning names I can get the author for the current name but of the name I provided to the search. For my particular use case I am using GBIF since they have an authoritative Carabidae dataset and they have the authors in the results pages like\r\nhttps://www.gbif.org/species/1035266\r\n\r\nThanks for a great tool.
