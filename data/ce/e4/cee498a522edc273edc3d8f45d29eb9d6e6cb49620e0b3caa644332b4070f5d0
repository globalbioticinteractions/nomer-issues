It's not great, and it's up to you whether something like this would be a fit for what you want to do.\r\n\r\n- Go to https://www.iucnredlist.org/search\r\n- Make sure you are logged in. I think I also had to fill out some form to explain why I wanted to download data.\r\n- Go for a search (e.g., open the \"Taxonomy\" tab, find Mammalia)\r\n- Click \"Download\" at the top right to download a CSV\r\n\r\nThis gave me two CSVs, I think one is supposed to represent the taxonomy and the other the assessments of individual species. I used that CSV to import the classification into my database at https://hesperomys.com/ce/84965; I also used this to create some spreadsheets I shared with Aja.\r\n\r\nRegarding versioning, there is a version number (currently 2024-1, 2024-2 scheduled for late October). Somebody at the meeting today (I think Anna) said that the versioning applies to the spatial data. I sort of trust it also applies to the taxonomy, but that's difficult to verify; I hope they don't continuously make changes without telling us.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/2417291628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/2417366671","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/94#issuecomment-2417366671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/94","id":2417366671,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc6QFhaP","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-16T16:40:34Z","updated_at":"2024-10-16T16:41:18Z","body":"@JelleZijlstra thanks for sharing your notes.\r\n\r\nI was able to repeat the steps you described to download a copy of the taxonomic backbone. \r\n\r\nI am baffled by why IUCN is making it so hard to re-use their taxonomic backbone.
