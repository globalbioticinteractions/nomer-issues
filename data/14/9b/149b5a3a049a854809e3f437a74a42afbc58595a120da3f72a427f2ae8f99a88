This from our data manager at AMNH:  \"Hi Nancy,\r\nIt seems to me there are two ways you could proceed.\r\nOption 1: Some collections assign a randomized, automatically generated GUID to each of their specimen records. We don't have the capability to automatically generate such GUIDs in our current version of EMu, but we will have that ability in the near future, once VZ upgrades to the latest version of EMu. At that point, it will be easy to generate and store GUIDs such as the following example:\r\ne83f4dc9-e7f4-4aa8-b056-d703c4e102c1\r\nSo, if you wanted to use GUIDs like the above for these two specimens, we could generate two such numbers now, store them temporarily in a note field in their corresponding EMu database records, and then once we upgrade EMu, we could transfer those values to the dedicated GUID fields in the newer version of EMu.\r\nOption 2: Because we don't currently generate GUIDs, and because portals such as VertNet request that we provide some kind of unique specimen ID with each record we provide to them, we have instead been generating more conventional but still globally unique numbers for our specimens. For example, the mammal specimen in your collection with catalog number M-100000 is represented by the following unique ID:\r\nurn:catalog:AMNH:Mammals:M-100000\r\n(where \"urn\" stands for Uniform Resource Name.) This string uniquely identifies the AMNH mammal specimen with this catalog number, and so serves the purpose of a globally unique identifier. This exact string is used to represent this mammal specimen on VertNet, GBIF, and iDigBio, as you can see here:\r\nhttp://portal.vertnet.org/o/amnh/mammals?id=urn-catalog-amnh-mammals-m-100000\r\nhttps://www.gbif.org/occurrence/859338650\r\nhttps://www.idigbio.org/portal/records/0593e3e4-c577-4964-953d-3b967817079c\r\nYou can see that all three pages include a term called \"OccurrenceID\" (or \"Occurrence ID\") whose value is \"urn:catalog:AMNH:Mammals:M-100000\".\r\nSo, if you want to follow this existing format, you could use these two values as Persistent Identifiers for your two type specimens:\r\nurn:catalog:AMNH:Mammals:M-279589\r\nurn:catalog:AMNH:Mammals:M-279590\r\nI tend to think that, at this point in time, the second approach makes the most sense, since it's consistent with what we're already doing, and since we have not yet started generating or providing randomized GUIDs for our specimen records. Of course, you may have a different opinion.\"\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1040410297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1040503873","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/74#issuecomment-1040503873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/74","id":1040503873,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc4-BNRB","user":{"login":"debpaul","id":2990155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTAxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2990155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/debpaul","html_url":"https://github.com/debpaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debpaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debpaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debpaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debpaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debpaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debpaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debpaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debpaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-15T16:43:46Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T17:15:58Z","body":"@jhpoelen et al, please note in the above response, the implications (some programmatic, some representing our current evolving standards-of-practice). \r\n- [ ] There will be (in-future) GUIDs for AMNH objects/records.\r\n- [ ] The current published **occurrenceIds** of type `urn:catalog:AMNH:Mammals:` remain relevant in the future, since they are already cited in literature\r\n- [ ] Best practice in future (once the GUIDs are minted) would be for the data provider (e.g. AMNH) to use (for now) the DwC Resource Relationship extension to share all **Identifers** known for an object. Relationship specified between the identifiers might be \"formerly known as\", \"also known as\", etc. And using a formal relationship identifier (as in from an ontology) instead of a string like \"formerly known as\" would be better/best practice.\r\n- [ ] This would (hopefully) mean that at wikidata, all these identifiers would be listed.\r\n- [ ] Do these identifiers represent or point to the `database record` or `physical object`? Does is matter if we agree on this or not? (e.g. for how we want to reference them, use them programatically). I think understanding of this, and implications, are still evolving. For me, for a concrete example, the dwc:catalogNumber is the local (and usually not GUID) identifier helping those managing the physical objects or using the physical objects to find and curate those objects. While, the non-human-interpretable GUIDS (like UUIDs) inherently represent the digital record b/c one needs to use that GUID to \"look up\" the local identifier.\r\n- [ ] Additionally, there is the fact that when aggregators ingest these records, they assign GUIDs to each record as well. There is an issue inherent in trying to understand if the record associated with a given GUID has changed (a la, the need for a SHA to go with a GUID and the date modified, etc).\r\n- [ ] And, for those downloading from aggregators, knowing what / whom it cite is not trivial. Why? Because we are still trying to figure out how to cite the aggregator, and the records in the dataset. AFAIK, the collections still don't get any sort of formal notification when their data is being cited.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1040503873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
