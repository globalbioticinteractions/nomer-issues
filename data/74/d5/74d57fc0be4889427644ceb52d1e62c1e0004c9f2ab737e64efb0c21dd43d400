Figure out how you want to encode this, if such a form is too verbose - that's a separate problem.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear that you need to say that 'Nathan U. claimed' this because there may be no other way to interpret the claim made in the source; there is no way to apply judgment to it because the source is perfectly clear (e.g. DwC parentNameUsageID clearly means < if there are at least two children).  It is simply a matter of fact that the source says [...] >< [...] or whatever. It is the source itself that is making the judgment.\r\n\r\nI'm also very uneasy about words like \"identify\" and even \"designate\" in connection with a taxon.  When we talk about a taxon we almost always just say something that constrains the interpretation of the name we use for the taxon. This is true even for 'sensu' names. It is nearly impossible to be exact in specifying a taxon (to 'identify' it). The best we can ever do (and what we should always do) is the 'sensu' form, which identifies the text of a set of claims around the taxon - which itself is only a constraint, not an 'identification'. (This is elementary model theory.)\r\n\r\nThe only time it's ever OK to do without a 'sensu' is if you're overwhelmingly sure the reader will interpret a name without any confusion.  So we don't need to say doi:10.1234/5678 sensu Crossref (as if that would help!).  And we don't need sensu in Darwin Core files or similar taxonomy-specific tables since the data set itself is a source of claims about the taxon. We have an implicit 'sensu D' on all names, where D is the data set.\r\n\r\nIf we're connecting information from multiple sources, we need an alignment, which is a set of judgments expressed in terms of 'sensu A' and 'sensu B' names, e.g. an alignment might say that X sensu A = X sensu B. If the alignment is only in Nathan's head, then we say that Nathan (on given date) says that X sensu A = X sensu B , etc. but it's better practice for an alignment between entire taxonomies to be stored for reference (by DOI or whatever).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1297866042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1297870040","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/114#issuecomment-1297870040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/114","id":1297870040,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc5NW-zY","user":{"login":"jar398","id":2035858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzU4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2035858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398","html_url":"https://github.com/jar398","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-01T00:58:27Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T01:00:11Z","body":"Maybe by \"Nathan U. claimed that Homo sapiens >< Chiroptera\" the intent is that these names are meant to be interpreted sensu GloBI.

The points could be points in geographic space (perhaps designated by lat/long coordinates), but in a taxonomy context the points are individual organisms. You don't have a region and can't use something with an RCC-5 relation unless you have said what points (individual organisms) you are talking about. Then ! says the regions/sets are disjoint, < is for inclusion, etc.  If you want to put ITIS to the right of ! you *have* to say what points you are talking about so that you can interpret it as a region. You have not done so and I don't think you should try to.\r\n\r\nSuppose someone said, e.g., ITIS < COL, and that there was some doubt as to whether this was true.  To determine whether it's the case, you would have to ask: is every point in region/taxon ITIS also a point in region/taxon COL?  Where the points are individual butterflies and sharks and so on? You'd have specify which individuals are in ITIS and which are in COL. That is not the kind of question you care about in here. And I bet you'd get logical inconsistencies if you went this route.\r\n\r\nIn talking about whether names are in databases, RCC-5 is simply the wrong logic. Say what you mean, instead.\r\n\r\nRCC-5 has a very weak toehold in the taxonomy business.

To repeat what I said before, if Abrocoma (the region) is in ITIS (whatever region you intende by that), then every organism in that genus is in ITIS, even if its species is not listed in ITIS. Membership in a taxon has to be determined by circumscription, not by looking at ITIS or any other aggregator.\r\nAnimalia is in ITIS.  That would mean that every individual in the Animalia taxon (given by... circumscription or characters) is in the ITIS region. Therefore Abrocoma bennettii is in ITIS. This just doesn't agree with the way you are using it.\r\n\r\nI'm not asking what ITIS is (although it is very clearly not a taxon, taxon concept, name, region, etc.). I'm saying that if you want to say something coherent, you have to provide a definition for determining membership of an individual organism in the taxon / region that you are associating with ITIS. (The association is by metonymy, which I already told you I don't like - a database is not a taxon and is not a region, and what you propose is confusing to human readers, and confusing to formal reasoners).  And even if you did have such a method, which you have not given, it would still be a bad idea.\r\n\r\nThe RCC-5 space used in taxonomy is the space of organisms, not the space of database records or names or taxon concepts or anything else human-made. You are clearly trying to recycle these relationships for a very different purpose (taxon concepts in sets of taxon concepts? or something like that) and it just looks gratuitous to me.\r\n\r\nWhy are you so insistent on trying to reuse RCC5 for this purpose, for which it was clearly not intended?  Instead of using relationships intended to make scientific statements, which you are not doing, why not just write that you are talking about membership of a name in a database, or whatever it is you're actually doing?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1398744919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1398807757","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/114#issuecomment-1398807757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/114","id":1398807757,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc5TYBzN","user":{"login":"jar398","id":2035858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzU4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2035858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398","html_url":"https://github.com/jar398","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jar398/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-20T18:58:20Z","updated_at":"2023-01-20T18:58:20Z","body":"Another way to say it: using RCC-5 for anything other than the specimen/organism memberships of taxon concepts would be destructive to the cause of getting people to use it in its main use case of biologically comparing taxon concepts.
