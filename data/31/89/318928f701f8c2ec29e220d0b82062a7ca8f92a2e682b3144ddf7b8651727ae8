It feels very fractal.  \r\n\r\nIt's fairly straightforward to explore the limitations of this thought experiment:\r\n\r\n* How will you define what's in the data-set?  For example by the time you start crawling you will have new datasets.\r\n* How will you identify candidates for inclusion in the data-set that are/not humanly chosen?\r\n* Do previous versions of the index of everything count as a data-set to be included in the next data-set? Why/not?\r\n* What happens when someone generates 400GB of random names that take *just enough* examination to understand that it's a joke, just for LOLs, are you grabbing that too?\r\n* How will you deal with vastly different metadata for your sources?\r\n* What protocols will you use to request data for ingestion?  IPFS?  IRC? HTTPS? File::IO? BitTorrent? Floppy disk controllers? How will you decide to/not use protocol X?\r\n\r\nPerhaps what is really being asked is how do we strengthen a practical approximation of this question e.g. @dimus approach in dwca_hunter?
