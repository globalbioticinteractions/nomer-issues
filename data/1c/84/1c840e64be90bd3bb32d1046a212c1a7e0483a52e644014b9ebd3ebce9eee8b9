In this case, a dataset happened to use taxon term id/name 9606/Homo sapiens , which mapped to NCBI:9606/Homo sapiens as expected. However, if another dataset used the same 9606 with a different name combination is match to another term, the resolving 9606 will give ambiguous results. \r\n\r\nSo, what we are seeing here is an example of using non-unique identifiers across different datasets. Still have to think a bit about how to best resolve this without making the id validation unnecessarily complex.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/401167148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/500011100","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/10#issuecomment-500011100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/10","id":500011100,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDAxMTEwMA==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-07T19:30:49Z","updated_at":"2019-06-07T19:30:49Z","body":"Now, \r\n```console\r\n$ echo -e \"9606\\t\" | nomer append\r\n9606\t\tNONE\t9606\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n```\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/500011100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
