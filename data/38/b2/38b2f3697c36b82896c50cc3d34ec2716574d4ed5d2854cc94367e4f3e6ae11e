They provide a file [chesshires-name-list.xlsx](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/files/10863599/chesshires-name-list.xlsx) that shows all original names pulled from their occurrence data aggregates (GBIF and SCAN) and their corrections via name alignment + ending corrections + final names after correction. This might be a great list to add for United States bees with their permission? It might also be a great way to tackle fuzzy names without implementing a character replacement algorithm into Nomer, as they provide names that have known incorrect spellings from aggregators like GBIF and their final resolution mapping.
