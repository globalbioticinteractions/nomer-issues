I still get them now however so Ill share what I found. \r\n\r\nStarting from the beginning: Chesshire has an outlined csv that denotes verbatim names (after parsing), 2 decision steps (one through automated name alignment, 2nd reviewed by taxonomist John Ascher), and 1 field containing notes on alignment decisions. This data can be found here: [chesshires-namelist.csv](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/files/10947260/chesshires-namelist.csv)\r\n\r\nTo test whether names that are noted as present in Discover Life, I greped out anything with \"DiscoverLife\" or \"DL\" within the field  that indicates alignment decisions. obtaining the following file (though removed one instance that suggested white space caused failure for alignment). I then ran these verbatimNames through nomer obtaining the following: \r\n[nomer-test-output.txt](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/files/10947272/nomer-test-output.txt)\r\n\r\nThis is where things get a bit tricky, there are still 385 names that fail to align. The following strings constitute for source of name change: \r\n\"accepted synonym when entered into DL website, still give to John\"\r\n\"collapsed subspecies/switched based on DL - still give to John\"\r\n\"DL list indicates that this is the accepted synonym\"\r\n\"Accepted Name in the DL list\"\r\n\"valid on ITIS and DL, Keep but do run by John\"\r\n\"On DL website and ITIS,  Keep but do run by John\"\r\n\"DL list indicates that this is the accepted synonym, pass by John\"\r\n\r\nProblem is I can't replicate their resolution across the name list by using DL. There are some instances where the name is definitely on discoverlife and unread by Nomer, some where the name pulls you to the genus by using the site (& is not on Nomer), Dead links on DL,  and others where the reason for mapping is completely off from what they suggest. \r\n\r\nFirst Case: Name is on DL and not currently seen by Nomer. \r\n`echo -e \"\\tPseudopanurgus parvus\" | nomer append discoverlife`\r\nyields\r\n\tPseudopanurgus parvus\tNONE\t\tPseudopanurgus parvus\r\n\r\nReason for name alignment given by Chesshire: \"Accepted Name in the DL list\"\r\nhttps://www.discoverlife.org/ shows it is present on DL through manual search options\r\n\r\nSecond Case: with mismatch mapping through the website search tool, but a correct synonym when final name was searched\r\n`echo -e \"\\tLasioglossum nymphaerum\" | nomer append discoverlife`\r\nyields\r\n\tLasioglossum nymphaerum\tNONE\t\tLasioglossum nymphaerum \r\n\r\nReason attached to this particular name for alignment is noted as \"accepted synonym when entered into DL website, still give to John\"\r\nSearching https://www.discoverlife.org/ with Lasioglossum nymphaerum yields just the Lasioglossum genus. Backtracking from their final decision made name we can see however that Lasioglossum nymphaerum is synonymous with Lasioglossum oceanicum. A similar scenario to this seems present for Andrena californica, though note the one that is actually searchable on DL is Andrena californica wickhami. \r\n\r\n\r\nThird case: Mapping fails, dead linkage on DL site\r\n`echo -e \"\\tHeterosarus bakeri\" | nomer append discoverlife` \r\nyields \r\nHeterosarus bakeri\tNONE\t\tHeterosarus bakeri\r\n\r\nReason noted for alignment: \"DL list indicates that this is the accepted synonym\"\r\nSearching name through DL yields a dead linkage? \r\nAuthors suggested name: Pseudopanurgus bakeri which does not have present synonyms...\r\n\r\nFourth Case: Presumed erroneous reason field for alignment in their name table\r\nex. \r\n`echo -e \"\\tHeterosarus helianthi\" | nomer append discoverlife`\r\nyields\r\n\tHeterosarus helianthi\tNONE\t\tHeterosarus helianthi\t\r\n\r\nReason for alignment: \"DL list indicates that this is the accepted synonym, pass by John\"\r\nWhen discover life is searched for this name you arrive at a moth in Lepitdoptera: Hellinsia helianthi (Walsingham, 1880)\r\nThe name they suggested is Pseudopanurgus helianthi , perserving the specificEpithet but opting for a bee genus. \r\nSee Ashmeadiella washingtonensis for another case of this where specificEpithet is preserved but the genus is dropped for unexplained reasons. Seems to be a purposeful decision, but that seems odd they didn't correctly note that decision.

Backtracking from their final decision made name we can see however that Lasioglossum nymphaerum is synonymous with Lasioglossum oceanicum. A similar scenario to this seems present for Andrena californica, though note the one that is actually searchable on DL is Andrena californica wickhami.\r\n\r\n@jtmiller28 Can you please provide some evidence to suggest that Lasioglossum nymphaerum is documented somewhere in DiscoverLife ?

Related to both 4 & 5, some names lack subgenus but need infraspecific epithets to be resolved. \r\nEx. \r\n`echo -e \"\\tNeolarra congregata\" | nomer append discoverlife`\r\nyields \r\nNeolarra congregata\tNONE\t\tNeolarra congregata\r\nDL website search shows infraspecific epithet is necessary for alignment, but notably lacks subgenus designation\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82229873/225394764-affb10a3-0d17-4a7e-981b-d0cc1ea07cac.png)\r\n`echo -e \"\\tNeolarra congregata helianthi\" | nomer append discoverlife`\r\nyields \r\nNeolarra congregata helianthi\tSYNONYM_OF\thttps://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Neolarra+verbesinae\tNeolarra verbesinae\t(Cockerell, 1895)\tspecies\t\tAnimalia | Arthropoda | Insecta | Hymenoptera | Apidae | Neolarra verbesinae\thttps://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Animalia | https://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Arthropoda | https://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Insecta | https://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Hymenoptera | https://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Apidae | https://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Neolarra+verbesinae\tkingdom | phylum | class | order | family | species\t\thttps://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Neolarra+verbesinae\r\n\r\nThose are the cases I've found overall at the moment. Notably 4,5,6 seem to be related issues. Hard to say if there is a \"good\" resolution for it, from my research experience occurrence data is hit or miss on inclusion of infraspecific epithets and subgenera. Technically, its not supposed to be included at all by taxonomic standards I believe, but has been fashioned in based upon expert taxonomist decisions (which is a rather subjective area that will lead to endless issues if we pursue in my opinion). This poses potential problems for nomer in workflow, considering parsing steps for aligning names removes the subgenus (). Infraspecific Epithets are maintained at least for the first round in my heirarchical use of Nomer alignment, however, lacking subgenus causes failure in resolution in 4 & 5. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1470490430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1536224236","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/149#issuecomment-1536224236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/149","id":1536224236,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc5bkOvs","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-05T12:57:48Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T12:57:48Z","body":"@jtmiller28 thanks for preparing the list of example related to the discoverlife name matches.
