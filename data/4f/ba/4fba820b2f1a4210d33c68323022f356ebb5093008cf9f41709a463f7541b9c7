Could also help with alternative usages of the same name, but we'd have to think about that more\r\n\r\nThanks!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1254011652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
