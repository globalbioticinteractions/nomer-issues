So, having specific versions of Catalogue of Life is a good thing, I think - when not using versioned copies, name alignment results may change on the time of day you'd run the alignment. \r\n\r\nI've created Nomer v0.5.3 https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/releases/tag/0.5.3 . This version allows for re-using \"older\" (months vs days old) pre-calculated indexed versions of Catalogue of Life. This should address your immediate need. \r\n\r\nIn addition, some changes are needed to accommodate newer catalogue of life schemas. I am hoping to address that sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\nSo, for now, Nomer support matching against a somewhat recent copy of Catalogue of Life. And, I am continuing to work towards supporting more up-to-date versions of Catalogue of Life. \r\n\r\nPerhaps this is a good example of the cost of \"big\" catalogs - because the catalog has everything in it (hundreds, perhaps thousands of checklists), there's likely to be changes daily: there's always some curation happening somewhere. Contrast this with modular publication of \"small\" catalogs - here, the changes are isolated to the particular taxonomic area that happen to be active, so the changes are isolated to small chunks. Another approach to reduce the costs of \"keeping up with the Jones's\" is to only upgrade when requested. The latter is the approach currently taken by Nomer: the Nomer Corpus of Taxonomic Resources keeps versioned copies of taxonomic resources, and these upgraded on demand. (e.g., #134 ).\r\n\r\nAlso, note that using Nomer 0.5.3, the expected Catalogue of Life matches (incl. higher order) appeared in alignment report retrieved via https://github.com/jhpoelen/higherwhit/actions/runs/6089923421 . See also attached alignment review. \r\n[alignment-report.zip](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/files/12536152/alignment-report.zip)\r\n\r\n@whitfarnum apologies for the verbose descriptions.
