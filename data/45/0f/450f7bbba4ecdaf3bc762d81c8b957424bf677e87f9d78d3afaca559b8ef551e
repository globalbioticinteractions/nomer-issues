Once you cross state boundaries it becomes less useful for designations, in fact it would likely be detrimental to assume the taxonomy of outside areas follows their catalogue. If it is possible in the future, it would make an interesting case study just to subset flora out by California's boundary and compare resolution services however since they are said to have the most accurate name database for California.
