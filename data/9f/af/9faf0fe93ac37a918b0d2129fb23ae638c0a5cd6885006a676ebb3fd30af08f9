first pass of term / link validation is now available in dev version of nomer.\r\n\r\nBy running ```echo -e \"EOL:123\\tname\\trank\\tcommon name @en\\tpath name | another path name\\tpath id | another path id\\tpath rank | another path rank\\t\\t\" | java -jar nomer/target/nomer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar validate-terms``` the following tsv output is created (displayed in table for ease of reading):\r\n\r\nOK | non empty | EOL:123 | name | rank | common name @en | path name \\| another path name | path id \\| another path id | path rank \\| another path rank |   |  \r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nOK | 9 columns | EOL:123 | name | rank | common name @en | path name \\| another path name | path id \\| another path id | path rank \\| another path rank |   |  \r\nOK | supported ids | EOL:123 | name | rank | common name @en | path name \\| another path name | path id \\| another path id | path rank \\| another path rank |   |  \r\nOK | consistent term path | EOL:123 | name | rank | common name @en | path name \\| another path name | path id \\| another path id | path rank \\| another path rank |   |  \r\nOK | non empty term path or path ids | EOL:123 | name | rank | common name @en | path name \\| another path name | path id \\| another path id | path rank \\| another path rank |   |  \r\nFAIL | supported path ids | EOL:123 | name | rank | common name @en | path name \\| another path name | path id \\| another path id | path rank \\| another path rank |   |  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe output pattern is: [validation results] [validation rule name] [validated record] . \r\n\r\nSimilar for term maps (or links), when running ```echo -e \"no id\\tsome name\\tEOL:1234\\tHomo sapiens\" | java -jar nomer/target/nomer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar validate-links```, the following is produced.\r\n\r\nOK | non empty | no id | some name | EOL:1234 | Homo sapiens\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nOK | 4 columns | no id | some name | EOL:1234 | Homo sapiens\r\nOK | supported resolved id | no id | some name | EOL:1234 | Homo sapiens\r\n\r\nBecause you can stream stuff too, you can validate massive amounts of data using pipes, greps, awks etc. For instance, to replicate results reported in #5 , you can now do:\r\n\r\n```curl -L \"https://zenodo.org/record/1213465/files/taxonCache.tsv.gz\" | gunzip | java -jar nomer/target/nomer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar validate-terms | grep FAIL > problems.tsv```

opinions.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/389619840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/389687905","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/8#issuecomment-389687905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/8","id":389687905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTY4NzkwNQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-16T22:37:37Z","updated_at":"2018-05-16T22:37:37Z","body":"A
