It appears that the inclusion of authorship in WFO's catalogue _can_ matter when considering taxonomic name resolution. To generate the dataset I used: \r\n\r\nnomer list --properties /path/to/myproperties wfo > wfo_names_w_authorship\r\n\r\nreading this list into R, I then organized it by grouping by the original scientific name and filtering for only instances where a identical name could occur twice, and then processed the resolvedScientificName mappings to be only unique resolutions. \r\n\r\nI built a .csv to summarize these instances of authorship dependent mapping (~32,000 names mapping instances). This relationship seems to trip nomer into printing two possible (taxonomically valid) mappings. \r\n\r\nAs an example: \r\necho -e \"\\t×Aegilotriticum requienii\\t(Ces., Pass. & Gibelli) P.Fourn.\"  | nomer append gn-parse | nomer append wfo\r\nProvides: \r\n×Aegilotriticum requienii\t(Ces., Pass. & Gibelli) P.Fourn.\tSAME_AS\t\t× Aegilotriticum requienii\t\t\t\t\tSYNONYM_OF\tWFO:0000841768\t×Aegilotriticum triticoides\tspecies\t\t×Aegilotriticum triticoides\tWFO:0000841768\tspecies\thttp://www.worldfloraonline.org/taxon/wfo-0000841768\r\n\t\r\n×Aegilotriticum requienii\t(Ces., Pass. & Gibelli) P.Fourn.\tSAME_AS\t\t× Aegilotriticum requienii\t\t\t\t\tHAS_ACCEPTED_NAME\tWFO:0001356228\t×Aegilotriticum requienii\tspecies×Aegilotriticum requienii\tWFO:0001356228\tspecies\thttp://www.worldfloraonline.org/taxon/wfo-0001356228\r\n\r\nThis is a bit undesirable since currently I believe nomer removes authorship from the output created (unsure if there's an option to change this), making it difficult to re-check multiple mapped names for intended authorship.
