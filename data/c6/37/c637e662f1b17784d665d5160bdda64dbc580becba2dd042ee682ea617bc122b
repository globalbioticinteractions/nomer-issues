Without having seen your base my.properties in previous issues, I probably would not of been able to build it without understanding Nomer better. \r\n\r\nWould it be worth considering adding a section on building proper properties files to create customized queries in the ReadMe? This might make it a bit more transparent when using this feature of Nomer. I am also finding more and more that its pretty useful for research and organization alike. Depending on the group your working with, specific information regarding some of the outputs are more important then others. For example: a lot of plant curation and organization is at the family level, therefore having your output have just a family level is really helpful for organization purposes. \r\n\r\nOf course this could just be a personal issue! I am still fairly new to the computer science world compared to biology. For example, when reading the ReadMe, I thought I might of been looking for something in the json section, but ended up being more confused.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1287422634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1287450431","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/120#issuecomment-1287450431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/120","id":1287450431,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc5MvO8_","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-21T21:25:49Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T21:25:49Z","body":"Thanks for your notes. \r\n\r\nI was thinking . . . would it help to include some examples as commented properties when typing \r\n\r\n```\r\nnomer properties \r\n```\r\n?\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnomer.append.schema.output=[{\"column\":0,\"type\":\"externalId\"},{\"column\": 1,\"type\":\"name\"},{\"column\": 2,\"type\":\"rank\"},{\"column\": 3,\"type\":\"commonNames\"},{\"column\": 4,\"type\":\"path\"},{\"column\": 5,\"type\":\"pathIds\"},{\"column\": 6,\"type\":\"pathNames\"},{\"column\": 7,\"type\":\"externalUrl\"},{\"column\": 8,\"type\":\"thumbnailUrl\"}]\r\n# uncomment specific schema examples below \r\n# including family name as a separate column\r\n# nomer.append.schema.output=[{\"column\":0,\"type\":\"externalId\"},{\"column\": 1,\"type\":\"name\"},{\"column\": 2,\"type\":\"rank\"},{\"column\": 3,\"type\":\"path.family.name\"}]\r\n# including family id as a separate column\r\n# nomer.append.schema.output=[{\"column\":0,\"type\":\"externalId\"},{\"column\": 1,\"type\":\"name\"},{\"column\": 2,\"type\":\"rank\"},{\"column\": 3,\"type\":\"path.family.id\"}]\r\n```\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1287450431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/comments/1287858604","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/120#issuecomment-1287858604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/120","id":1287858604,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvmSqc5Mwyms","user":{"login":"jtmiller28","id":82229873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjI5ODcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82229873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28","html_url":"https://github.com/jtmiller28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtmiller28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-22T17:13:32Z","updated_at":"2022-10-22T17:13:32Z","body":"Yes I believe that would be a great addition, just some guidance on using it adding specific paths for customized queries would be great.
